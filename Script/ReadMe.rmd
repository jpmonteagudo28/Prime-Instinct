# README file

This repo contains data, scripts and a README file.

## Data

The data for this repo was scraped from the [Prime Glossay](https://t5k.org/glossary/) site. The .txt file contains information on Carmichael numbers or probable primes (PRP) up to 500 for based 2 through 20 (binary through vigesimal).


## Scripts

The `Scripts` file contains `R scripts` for prime sieve, Fermat's Little Theorem,prime factorization,prime counting functions;missing package function and a web scraper script.  
The package used to generate these functions is the [`gmp` package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gmp/index.html). Additionally, the `rbenchmark` package was used to evaluate the sieve function in the global environment, replicating it 100 times. 

The `Prime_Finder` script contains a `find_multiples` function which yields a list of multiples of a number up to the specified limit.
